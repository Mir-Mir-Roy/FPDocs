It's main task is to quickly and conveniently change the Pivot Orientation, Origin and 3D Cursor positions by pressing one key, eliminating the need to select the desired component of a mesh and long travel through different menus to select a necessary action. Just press and hold D button, hover cursor mouse above desire and highlighted component and click LMB, MMB or RMB to change pivot. Or use Pivot gizmo to move Origin in 3D space or set custom pivot orientation. Both are with incremental system now. In addition Bbox gizmo helps adjust Origin and 3D cursor inside current object's boundaries. Now the addon supports bones and curves. All future updates are free . It\u2019s available on Gumroad Blender Market Video Intro Current version update's video Features Change Pivot Transform orientation. Change Origin and 3D Cursor positions. Requirements Blender 2.80 or higher. Latest version The latest version of Friendly Pivot Addon is 0.4.0 . Installation Start Blender, then Edit \u2192 User Preferences \u2192 Add-ons tab, Press 'Install' button, locate and select downloaded friendly_pivot zip file, Activate the addon, save user settings , Close preferences. Quick usage Select Blender object, press and hold D (invoke key by default, changeable ) and hover mouse cursor above desire component, press LMB to conform Pivot Transform Orientation or RMB to transform Origin to highlighted component. In addition while pressing D key press and hold S key when click LMB to set Origin at the same time and position. Or while pressing D key press and hold C key to set 3D Cursor position when click RMB . Simple. Known issues The addon in BETA and works well but could be errors. With negative object scale conformed axis flipped and preview loss orientation. If release invoke key while MMB the addon continues to highlight components and preview local axis. Just press invoke key again to stop the issue. If press LMB+RMB it imprints component's conform in viewport.
