It's main task is to quickly and conveniently change the Pivot Orientation, Origin and 3D Cursor positions by pressing one key, eliminating the need to select the desired component of a mesh and long travel through different menus to select a necessary action. Just press and hold D button, hover cursor mouse above desire and highlighted component and click LMB, MMB or RMB to change pivot. Or use Pivot gizmo to move Origin in 3D space or set custom pivot orientation. Both are with incremental system now. In addition Bbox gizmo helps adjust Origin and 3D cursor inside current object's boundaries. All future updates are free . It\u2019s available on Gumroad Blender Market Video Intro Current version update's video Features Change Pivot Transform orientation. Change Origin and 3D Cursor positions. Requirements Blender 2.80 or higher. Latest version The latest version of Friendly Pivot Addon is 0.3.3 . Installation Start Blender, then Edit \u2192 User Preferences \u2192 Add-ons tab, Press 'Install' button, locate and select downloaded friendly_pivot zip file, Activate the addon, save user settings , Close preferences. Quick usage Select object(mesh), press and hold D (invoke key by default, changeable ) and hover mouse cursor above desire mesh component, press LMB to conform Pivot Transform Orientation or RMB to transform Origin to highlighted component. In addition while pressing D key press and hold S key when click LMB to set Origin at the same time and position. Or while pressing D key press and hold C key to set 3D Cursor position when click RMB . Simple. In some cases addon behaves as local orientation and not as native blender normal mode for verts axis. Limitations Works only for meshes now. Known issues The addon in BETA and works well but could be errors. With negative object scale conformed axis flipped and preview loss orientation. If release invoke key while MMB the addon continues to highlight components and preview local axis. Just press invoke key again to stop the issue. If press LMB+RMB it imprints component's conform in viewport. Contact If there is an existed error, please press Report a Bug button in Blender preference Friendly Pivot addon's section.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#friendly-pivot-addon-documentation","text":"Friendly Pivot addon mimics the functionality of the Autodesk Maya Pivot Transform tool with minor differences, improvements and updates for Blender.

While this mode is active there is an ability to navigate through viewport, switch submodes, change Pivot Orientation, set 3D Cursor and Origin. Pivot Gizmo: This visual control gives ability to set Orientation and Origin freely. Supports any blender object type. 'P' button in left bottom corner switches On/Off Pivot gizmo. There is a value next to the 'P' counting Pivot's distance for current axis( 'D' ) when moving/incrementing the gizmo or current rounded value( 'V' ) when rounding value. Press Alt - Round current axis value. To round current decimal value to whole number press Alt and move axis arrow in desired direction to floor or ceiling a value. Alt + Shift combination rounds value to first decimal place for better accuracy. For Dial Pivot value is being round to nearest whole number automatic(if 1.45 => 1.0, if 1.55 => 2.0). Current rounded value is being display in the left bottom corner with V character. Press Shift , Ctrl or Shift+Crtl - Activate incremental system for current axis. Main action: Press D + LMB - To set just Transform Orientation. Press D + MMB - To set only 3D Cursor to highlighted. Press D + RMB - To set only Origin to highlighted. Additional shortcuts with main action give some options: Press D + S + LMB or RMB - set Origin and Orientation or vice versa. Press D + C + RMB - To set 3D Cursor ( this suits if 2 button mouse ). Additional shortcuts while holding D key: Press O - To switch On/Off Pivot to Cursor settings. Press P - To switch On/Off SCPO into Active Transform Tools settings. Multiselection submode: Press D + A + MMB or RMB - To activate multi selection mode for 3D Cursor or Origin. If release A - To set(confirm) Cursor or Origin between selection. If release D - To exit the mode without confirmation. One axis submode: Press D + X or Y or Z + RMB - To set Origin to one axis. Bounding Box Gizmo: Press D + B - To activate Bounding Box Gizmo and widget. Press D + B + MMB or RMB - To set 3D Cursor or Origin to bbox point.
